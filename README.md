## 🌐 Networking Architecture

### Peer-to-Peer Implementation
Your VR Pair Programming tool uses a sophisticated P2P networking system:

#### Connection Flow
1. **Host Setup**: One developer starts as host using `NetworkManagerVR.StartHost()`
2. **Client Connection**: Other developers connect as clients to the host's IP/port
3. **Relay Fallback**: If direct P2P fails, automatically switches to Unity Relay
4. **Player Spawning**: SpawnManager places each developer at designated spawn points
5. **Real-time Sync**: All interactions, code changes, and VR movements synchronized

#### Key Components
- **NetworkManagerVR**: Custom network manager handling P2P and Relay connections
- **SpawnManager**: Thread-safe player spawning with round-robin spawn point allocation
- **NetworkPlayerColor**: Example of real-time synchronization (demonstrates how code changes will sync)
- **NetworkUIManager**: Connection interface for host/client/disconnect controls

Instead of: "Write a NetworkManager script"
Ask: "Why do we need a NetworkManager, and what should it handle?"
```

#### Test Everything Thoroughly
- Don't assume AI-generated code works perfectly
- Test each component independently and as part of the system
- Understand failure modes and edge cases

#### Iterate Based on Real Needs
- Start with AI suggestions but adapt them to your specific requirements  
- Don't be afraid to ask for explanations of modifications
- Build understanding through the refinement process

#### Document Your Learning
- Keep track of concepts learned, not just code written
- Explain complex parts in your own words
- Create notes that help you remember key insights

### Practices to Avoid

#### Blind Copy-Paste
- Never use code you don't understand
- Always ask for explanation of unfamiliar patterns
- Make sure you can modify and debug the code independently

#### Over-Dependence
- Gradually take on more implementation work yourself
- Use AI for guidance rather than complete solutions
- Build confidence in your own problem-solving abilities

#### Skipping Fundamentals
- Don't skip learning basic concepts even if AI can handle implementation
- Understand the underlying principles behind the code
- Build a foundation that supports independent development

## Looking Forward
